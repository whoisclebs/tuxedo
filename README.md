Tuxedo is a lightweight, chainable HTTP client library for Go that simplifies working with the standard net/http package. With a clean, intuitive API inspired by popular libraries like Resty, Tuxedo allows you to build and execute HTTP requests with minimal boilerplate code. It supports setting headers, bodies, and even tracing, and comes with built-in JSON unmarshaling for easy response handling. Ideal for developers who need a simple yet powerful tool to streamline HTTP interactions in Go projects.
